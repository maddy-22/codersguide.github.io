        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of
            Web pages, including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to
            the users.</p>
        <p>CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of HTML and can be used
            with any XML-based markup language. Now let’s try to break the acronym:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cascading: Falling of Styles</li>
            <li>Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags</li>
            <li>Sheets: Writing our style in different documents</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Internal, External and Inline CSS Styles</h2>
        <p>Let’s start by talking about the Internal style. CSS styles done this way are loaded each
            time a website is refreshed, which may increase loading time. Additionally, you won’t be
            able to use the same CSS style on multiple pages as it’s contained within a single page.
            However, this also comes with benefits. Having everything on one page makes it easier to
            share the template for a preview.</p>

        <p>The External method might be the most convenient one. Everything is done externally on
            a .css file. This means you can do all the styling on a separate file and apply the CSS
            to any page you want. The External style might also improve loading times.</p>

        <p>Lastly, we will talk about the Inline style of CSS. Inline works with specific elements
            that have the "style" tag. Each component has to be stylized, so it might not be the
            best or fastest way to handle CSS. But it can come in handy. For example, if you want
            to change a single element, quickly preview changes, or maybe you don’t have access to
            the CSS files.</p>

        <h2>Why we learn CSS?</h2>
        <p>Styling has been an essential property for any website since many decades. It increases the
            standards and overall look of the website which makes it easier for the user to interact with
            it. A website cannot be made without CSS, as styling is MUST since no user would want to
            interact with a dull and shabby website. So for knowing Web Development, learning CSS is must.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base for web development:</strong> HTML and CSS is the basic skill that every web developer
                should know.
                It is the basic skill that is required for building a website.</li>
            <li><strong>Makes your website look attractive:</strong> A website that’s dull and plain will not attract
                the user most probably, so
                adding some style would surely make your website presentable to the user.</li>
            <li><strong>Makes the design come live:</strong> A web developer is responsible in making the design given
                to him as a live product. CSS is used for
                styling to develop the design of the website. </li>
            <li><strong>Increases user experience of website:</strong> A website with a simple yet beautiful UI would
                help the users to go through the website easily. CSS
                is used to make the user interface better.</li>
            <li><strong>More career opportunities:</strong> Since CSS is a basic requirement while learning Web
                Development, therefor there are abundant career opportunities for
                it. As a freelancer too you can land up to many projects.</li>
