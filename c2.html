        <h2>What is C Programming Language?</h2>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible 
            to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively 
            used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex 
            programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.</p>

           <p>It is said that 'C' is a god's programming language. One can say, C is a base for the 
               programming. If you know 'C,' you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming 
               languages that uses the concept of 'C'</p>
            
            <p>It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an 
                important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.</p>

        <h2>Where is C used? Key Applications:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>'C' language is widely used in embedded systems.</li>
            <li>It is used for developing system applications.</li>
            <li>It is widely used for developing desktop applications.</li>
            <li>Most of the applications by Adobe are developed using 'C' programming language.</li>
            <li>It is used for developing browsers and their extensions. Google's Chromium is built 
                using 'C' programming language.</li>
            <li>It is used to develop databases. MySQL is the most popular database software which is 
                built using 'C'.</li>
            <li>It is used in developing an operating system. Operating systems such as Apple's OS X, 
                Microsoft's Windows, and Symbian are developed using 'C' language. It is used for 
                developing desktop as well as mobile phone's operating system.</li>
            <li>It is used for compiler production.</li>
            <li>It is widely used in IOT applications.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why learn C Language?</h2>
        <p>As we studied earlier, 'C' is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning 'C' 
            as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages. 
            It shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. 
            'C' can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple language and provides faster 
            execution. There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the current market.</p>


        <p>'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. 
            Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This 
            structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.</p>

        <p>'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions 
            that make programming very efficient.</p>

        <p>It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on 
            other machines. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another 
            computer.</p>
